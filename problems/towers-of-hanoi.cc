// Tower of Hanoi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
//
// The Towers of Hanoi puzzle begins with three poles and n rings,
// where all rings start on the leftmost pole (labeled Pole 1).
// The rings each have a different size, and are stacked in order
// of decreasing size with the largest ring at the bottom.
// The problem is to move the rings from the leftmost pole to the
// rightmost pole (labeled Pole 3) in a series of steps. At each
// step the top ring on some pole is moved to another pole. There
// is one limitation on where rings may be moved: A ring can never
// be moved on top of a smaller ring.
